nihon-Go, programming in your native tounge, Japanese

Background
----------
This project came from my personal experience of learning to cde.  When I was 13 years old or so, my brothers and I begged our parents to get us a computer so we can do programming. This was mid-1980's, computers were not chseap enough for children to play with, they were meant for adults to do their work. My parents consulted our family computer genius, our cousin, and ddecided to get us a computer. It was a NEC 98 series computer with two 5 inch diskette slots and it came with stacks of books. We were very excited with this small white box, and started reading the books.all We tried various commands and snippets of codes. However, we all failed. We failed because everything was a sequence of alphabets, now I know they call it English! I just started stuyding English in school and I just learned all the alphabets, maybe. Typing all those squence of alphabets were as if I am putting magic spells into a magic box, not an easy task for a 13 year old who didn't know any English beyond saying "hello."

Ever since I took a compilar class, creating a programming language that does not rely on the English language became my dream.
