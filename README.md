nihon-Go, coding in my native tounge, Japanese

Goals
-----
* Create an easily maintainable wrapper to an existing programming language so that it removes the hurdles of learning English before learning to program. I'm considering Go programming laguage, since it supports UTF 8 natively.
* The wrapper should only serve as a bridge to a real world programming language while users are improving English levels are sufficient to learn to program.
* Provide the learning materials including, but not limited to, books, videos, and interactive teaching program.

Non-Goals
--------
* Inventing a completey new programming language.
* Adapt the Japanese language syntax into programming languages. Learning English based programming languages is an unavoidable fact of the 21st century.
* Translating keywords.  There are some variance in keywords from one language to another one, however, the core of the keywords are about the same. Learning keywords in English is worth the time at the begining.
 
Background
----------
This project came from my personal experience of learning to code.  When I was 13 years old or so, my brothers and I begged our parents to get us a computer so we can do programming. This was mid-1980's, computers were not chseap enough for children to play with, they meant for adults to do their work. My parents consulted our family computer genius, our cousin, and ddecided to get us a computer. It was a NEC 98 series computer with two 5 inch diskette slots and it came with stacks of books. We were very excited with this small white box, and started reading the books. We tried various commands and snippets of codes. However, we all failed. We failed because everything was a sequence of alphabets, now I know they call it English! I just started stuyding English in school and I just learned all the alphabets, maybe. Typing all those squence of alphabets were as if I am putting magic spells into a magic box, not an easy task for a 13 year old who didn't know any English beyond saying "hello." 
Years has passed since then. I moved to the US, and I learned to speak, read and write in English. I came across with a magic box again in college. I was hooked on the day one I got the magic box, the commands had no meanings back then, but no longer. I spent days playing with it, and customizing it. I finally learned to code after a few years of playing with the magic box. I even decided to abadan my first choice of career, and shifted to study magic boxes.   
Ever since I took a compilar class, creating a programming language that does not rely on the English language became my dream. So, here is my first attempt.
